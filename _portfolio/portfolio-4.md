For my thesis study, I developed multiple applications based on an EVD training simulator for trajectory training. The purpose of these applications was to be used as a factor of comparison in an effort to determine if any of the hardware devices, or modalities (AR vs VR) were preferable for medical technical skills training. The application was based off of an exsiting simulator, then completely remade in Unity3D and deployed to multiple devices: HTC Vive, Microsoft HoloLens 2, Meta Quest 2 and Android phone (powered by Vuforia).

More information on the findings and for a more complete explanation about the study done, please refer to my doctoral thesis.

Below several images can be seen of the applications in action:
